1. Create Interface IXOGame and impement it via XOGame class (Last) 
2. Create Interface for class IPlayer 
3. Create Interface for class IHumanPlayer,IScanPlayer and IRandomPlayer 
4. Implement all playeres 
5. Register all classes in factory so we can work with them dynamically (Almost full support on it )  
6. Unit test for Random and ScanPlayer 




IXOBoard,IXOBoardView 
IPlayer 
	bool makeMove(IXOBoard)

IHumanPlayer
IScanPlayergr
IRandomPlayer implements IPlayer


abstract class Player =>IPlayer 
	property XorO
	makeMove(IXOBoard ) no implementation 

HumanPlayer:Player, IHumanPlayer
ScanPlayer: Player,IScanPlayer
RandomPlayer:Player,IRandomPlayer
